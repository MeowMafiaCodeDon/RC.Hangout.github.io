## RC Hangout Community Guidelines

Welcome to the RC Hangout. This document serves as the foundational constitution for our community, outlining the principles and structures that guide our collective existence. Our primary goal is to foster a vibrant, respectful, and self-sustaining digital environment. This is achieved through a dual-pronged philosophical approach: the first focuses on the ethical development of our staff moderators, and the second on the radical empowerment of our general membership through a system of rotating community guides. These concepts are deeply interwoven, each reinforcing the other to create a resilient and adaptive social ecosystem.

### The Moderator's Path: Mitigating Personal Bias in Enforcement

The role of a staff moderator is not that of an untouchable ruler but of a dedicated custodian. The first and most crucial step in this journey is the explicit acknowledgment that personal bias is an inescapable component of human judgment. Our moderators are encouraged not to pretend bias does not exist, but to proactively engage in practices that minimize its influence on their official actions. This begins with a deep and continuous engagement with the community's written rules, moving beyond mere memorization to a philosophical understanding of their intent—to protect the psychological safety and constructive discourse of the server as a whole. When a potential infraction occurs, a moderator is trained to engage in a moment of personal reflection before acting, asking critical questions: Am I interpreting this situation through a personal grievance or past interaction with this member? Would I make the same decision if this involved a different member with whom I have a more neutral relationship? Is my action aligned with the literal and spiritual text of the rule, or am I stretching the rule to fit a personal feeling?

This internal process is supported by external structures. Significant moderation actions, such as temporary bans or escalations, are not performed in a vacuum. They require a brief but mandatory consultation with at least one other staff member. This creates a system of peer review, not to assign blame, but to provide a second perspective, a check against individual blind spots. Furthermore, all moderators participate in regular, private debriefings where recent decisions are discussed in a non-punitive, educational context. Here, hypothetical scenarios are explored, and the nuances of rule application are debated. This continuous training reinforces the idea that moderation is a skill built on consistency, empathy, and the humble recognition of one's own fallibility. The ultimate aim is to cultivate a moderation style that is perceived by the community as fair, predictable, and impersonal, thereby building a bedrock of trust upon which the entire community can rely.

### The Community Guide System: Decentralizing Power and Fostering Collective Stewardship

While a dedicated, bias-aware staff forms a stable foundation, a truly healthy community cannot be solely managed from the top down. To this end, we have instituted the system of Community Guides. This is a rotating role granted to trusted, long-standing members of the community. The selection process is designed to be transparent and based on a history of positive, constructive participation. The power granted to a Community Guide is intentionally specific and limited: the authority to mute other members in a channel for a short, predetermined duration. This is a powerful tool for de-escalation, but it is not the power to warn, kick, or ban. This precise limitation is crucial; it addresses the most common disruption to conversation—overwhelming noise or immediate, acute toxicity—without granting the full weight of permanent disciplinary action.

The philosophy behind this rotation is fractal in nature. Just as we seek to minimize centralized, personal bias in our staff, we seek to decentralize the very influence of moderation by distributing a small piece of it across the community itself. A rotating Guide does not have time to become comfortable with their micro-authority in a way that might breed corruption; their term is long enough to be effective but short enough to prevent the consolidation of power. This constant circulation ensures that a diversity of perspectives is brought to the role, preventing any single clique from dominating the community's tone. It transforms moderation from a distant, staff-only concern into a shared responsibility. Members are more likely to respect a mute from a peer they recognize as a fellow community enthusiast, and the act of serving as a Guide fosters a deeper understanding of the challenges of community management, creating a more empathetic and cooperative membership overall. This system proactively troubleshoots community issues by empowering the community to police its own low-level conflicts, freeing the core staff to handle more complex situations and strategic planning.

### Synthesis and Recursive Elaboration: The Interlocking Systems of a Resilient Community

When we recursively examine these two systems, we see their deep interconnection. The staff moderators, operating under their strict protocols to minimize bias, serve as the constitutional court and the long-term guardians of the server's health. They handle the appeals, the complex edge cases, and the persistent problems that the Community Guide system is not designed to address. The Community Guides, meanwhile, are the community's first responders. They are the living embodiment of the community's ability to self-regulate. The existence of a reliable, fair staff team makes the Community Guide system possible, as it provides a clear escalation path and a backstop against any potential misuse of the mute power. Conversely, the success of the Community Guide system validates the staff's approach; a community that can manage its own minor conflicts is one that has deeply internalized the values the staff strives to uphold.

This creates a fractal relationship of trust and responsibility. The staff must trust the community enough to grant a segment of its power to rotating Guides. The community must trust the staff to use their broader powers judiciously and to support the Guides in their duties. Each member, whether a regular user, a current Guide, or a staff moderator, is a custodian of the community's culture. The rules are not just enforced from above; they are lived from within. The rotating Guide role is a practical mechanism for this living practice, a recurring opportunity for members to step up and directly contribute to the health of the social space they enjoy. This recursive loop—where good faith from the staff encourages responsible behavior from the community, which in turn justifies further decentralization of power—creates a powerfully resilient and adaptive system. It is a community that is not merely managed, but one that is truly, proactively, and collectively owned by its members.
